    <!-- QPT-1 PROJECT -->
    <section>
      <h2>Introducing QPT-1 – Our First Health Revolution</h2>
      <p>
        At Qemb, our health journey begins with <strong>QPT-1</strong> — an advanced AI model for early breast cancer detection.
        QPT-1 is an intelligent, self-learning diagnostic system designed for precision and accuracy.
        By integrating it directly with mammography systems, QPT-1 continually improves its detection capabilities over time, offering clinicians real-time, highly reliable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        This groundbreaking system has the potential to detect anomalies at their earliest stages, giving patients the best possible chance for successful treatment.

    <!-- DIGITAL TWIN VISION -->
    <section>
      <h2>The Long-Term Vision: Building the Digital Human Twin</h2>
      <p>
        Our ultimate goal extends far beyond single-disease detection.
        We envision creating a <strong>full digital twin of the human body</strong> — a virtual replica that includes both anatomical and physiological details.
        This digital twin would allow researchers and doctors to simulate, monitor, and predict the progression of diseases without ever touching the patient.
        This will involve monitoring the interaction of cells, biomolecules and pathogens, and consequently finding the solution. We are envisioning finding
        a solution to all diseases, not just treatment but finding a cure.
      </p>
      <p>
        By coupling AI with quantum technology, we aim to run complex, ultra-fast simulations to test treatments,
        find cures for chronic illnesses, and ultimately, pave the way to a <em>disease-free future</em>.
      </p>

    <!-- HOW AI + QUANTUM WILL CHANGE MEDICINE -->
    <section>
      <h2>AI + Quantum: The Cure Engine</h2>
      <p>
        Quantum computing enables calculations that are practically impossible with traditional systems,
        while AI brings the power of pattern recognition, learning, and predictive analysis.
        Together, they form the <strong>Cure Engine</strong> — a platform capable of modeling human biology at unprecedented detail,
        finding hidden correlations in medical data, and rapidly testing millions of treatment pathways.
      </p>

    <!-- GLOBAL IMPACT -->
    <section>
      <h2>Global Health Access</h2>
      <p>
        At Qemb, we believe that cutting-edge medical technology should not be a luxury.
        Our solutions are designed with scalability and accessibility in mind, ensuring that communities
        in underserved regions can benefit from life-saving diagnostics and treatment innovations.
